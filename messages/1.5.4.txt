# Version 1.5.4

* Add basic Markdown highlighting to non-tag text
    This is a bare-bones replacement for the previous full markdown support. It's focused on a few common blocks and inline formatting at the expense of most fancy stuff.
* Add inline Markdown to the @appearance and @dead tags

## Supported markdown:

* Headers (# header)
* Bulleted lists with the * , -, and + characters
* Numbered lists using 1. or 1) formatting
* inline *italic* and **bold**
* basic inline links [link text](link-url)

The @appearance and @dead tags support *italic*, **bold**, and [links](url).
